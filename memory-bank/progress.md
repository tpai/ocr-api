- Documented system architecture
- **Project Foundation**
  - Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
  - Implemented configuration management with environment variables
  - Set up proper project structure with src/ and tests/ directories
- **LM Studio Integration**
  - Implemented LMStudioClient for API communication
  - Created OCR processing methods for images and text
  - Removed unused health check and model listing methods
- **File Processing**
  - Implemented FileProcessor for image and PDF handling
  - Added file validation and format detection
  - Created PDF text extraction and image conversion
- **API Implementation**
  - Built streamlined FastAPI server with essential endpoints
  - Implemented /ocr POST endpoint with file upload
  - Added basic health check endpoint (/)
  - Created simple, user-friendly error handling
- **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Created test scripts in tests/ directory
  - Added manual API testing script (updated for simplified API)
  - Implemented unit tests for configuration
- **Documentation**
  - Created comprehensive README with setup instructions
  - Added API usage examples and troubleshooting guide
  - Updated documentation to reflect simplified API
- **Code Quality**
  - Refactored all modules to remove unused imports
  - Removed unnecessary code and methods
  - Cleaned up dependencies and improved maintainability
  - Simplified error messages for better user experience

## In Progress 🔄
- Project complete and ready for production use

## Next Steps 📋
1. **Deployment Ready**
   - Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
   - Copy and configure .env file from .env.example
   - Start LM Studio and load RolmOCR model
   - Run server with `python3 run_server.py`
   
2. **Optional Future Enhancements**
   - Add comprehensive logging system
   - Implement batch processing for multiple files
   - Add authentication/authorization
   - Create Docker containerization
   - Add performance monitoring

## Blocked/Issues 🚫
- None currently

## Key Decisions Made 📝
- **Framework**: FastAPI chosen for simplicity and auto-documentation
- **Architecture**: Simple monolithic structure appropriate for this scope
- **Response Format**: JSON with success/error pattern
- **File Handling**: Process and discard (no persistent storage)
- **LM Studio Integration**: Dynamic model selection instead of hardcoded paths
- **Testing Structure**: Organized under tests/ directory as requested
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- **Error Handling**: Simple, user-friendly error messages instead of technical details
- **Code Quality**: Refactored to remove all unused imports and unnecessary code

## Technical Debt 📊
- None yet (greenfield project)

## Testing Strategy 🧪
- Manual testing with sample images and PDFs
- Endpoint testing with various file types
- Error condition testing

## Deployment Notes 🚀
- Local development server initially
- Can be containerized later if needed
- Model files must be accessible at specified path
